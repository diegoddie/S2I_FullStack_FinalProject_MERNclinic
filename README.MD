# WELCOME TO MYCLINIC! üè•
This project is a Full Stack MERN application for a private clinic. It focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly interface for managing clinic operations. 
This is my final project for the Start2Impact's master in Full Stack Development.

I deployed the backend with Render and the frontend using Vercel. Additionally, the project is accessible at www.myclinic.tech, a domain purchased from Namecheap.

For further details please take a look at the presentation inside the repo.
